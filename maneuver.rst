Maneuver Memory Items
---------------------

"APAMCO"
========

- Altitude
- Power
- Airspeed
- Mixture
- Clearing Turns: two 90° turns (left & right)
- Outside Reference

Slow Flight
===========
- A: completed >1500 AGL
- P: bottom of the green
- A: normal
- M: full rich
- C & O
- Landing config flow
- Pitch & trim for 55-60kts
- Add power when roll in
- Turns gently (≤15° bank)
- Recover ("go-round"):

  - Full power & flaps 20°
  - Pos. rate & 60kts
  - Flaps 10° (clear from obstacle)
  - Flaps up (safe altitude & 65kts)

Steep Turns
===========
- A: completed >1500 AGL
- P: bottom of the green; as required for target airspeed
- A: <Va
- M: no change
- C & O
- Establish 45° bank
- Add power when roll in
- Use horizon to maintain VS., check and maintain altitude and airspeed
- Roll out in advance to avoid overshooting

Stall: Power Off
================
- A: completed >1500 AGL
- P: no change
- A: normal
- M: full rich
- C & O
- Power to idle (≥1000 RPM for safety)
- Dump all flaps when airspeed permits
- Pitch for Vg (68-70kts) (call out)
- Pitch (slowly) to an attitude that induces a stall (call out) and wait
- Recover

  - Reduce AOA.
  - Full power and slow-flight recovery

Stall: Power On
===============
- A: completed >1500 AGL
- P: bottom of the green; as required for target airspeed
- A: 60kts
- M: full rich
- C & O
- Simultaneously increase pitch (slowly) and apply 65-100% power
- Stay coordinated with rudder to avoid spin
- Pitch (slowly) to an attitude that induces a stall (call out) and wait
- Recover:

  - Reduce AOA.
  - Full power

Emergency Descent
-----------------
- "TTTCC"

  - Trim for Vg (68-70kts)
  - Turn (make necessary shallow/steep turns to stay over the chosen area)
  - Troubleshoot (checklist)
  - Communicate
  - Commit to landing

- Glide to the chosen area
- First circle:

  - establish visual/sink rate reference for later turns
  - finalize the descent strategy

- Stay above the chosen area by circling
- Aim for 1000AGL on the final downwind
- Land on the "runway"

Ground Reference Maneuver
-------------------------

Turn Around a Point
===================
- Find a reliable point
- Start from the downwind
- Use a shallower/steeper bank angle to correct for the drift
- Stay coordinated throughout the maneuver
- Make a 360° circle and focus on outside
